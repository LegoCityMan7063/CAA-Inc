# Canada-Academy-of-Arts
This is the official website of my dad's art school, built using the static site generator Gatsby. The frontend is built using React and the backend for the artwork images is built with MongoDB and Amazon S3, with GraphQL querying.  

Feel free to improve the site by forking and sending a pull request with the proposed changes! My web dev skills could use some help... ^^;
